00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,240
This is where you'll lay your dust!

3
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,440
Here! You punks! You gypsy-dog iron smiths!

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,320
Animal control will get to you eventually, you clowns!

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,400
Swedish girls, aged fifteen to eighteen. 
From their mom's breast straight to consumption.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,080
Marika will straighten you out. Start with the washing.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,040
Speedboat-rides under the moonlight.

8
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,120
Boo, you herdsman!

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,040
Here we'll erect your grave! Here we'll erect your grave!

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,640
Come on, let's go.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,560
- I'm coming Thasos. I'm coming...

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,640
...fish, oregano, oil and lemon sauce, boiled lobster...

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,560
...two meter long breams. This big!

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Morons!

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
- Boo!

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,040
- Bye, you fools!

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,640
- Bye, farewell!

<b><u>Let the Women Wait</b><i></u></i>

20
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,260
- Tell me, want us to stay in Kavala today and move towards Kara Orman?

21
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,880
...there, I can fish for something and I'll take care of you too. 
- That is not possible, Panos...

22
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,360
- Why? 
- Because Antonis is waiting. You know what 
he told me on the phone?

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,380
"You laid three families on me and you are enjoying your freedom in Thessaloniki."

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,340
- Why didn't you tell him...

25
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,440
..."you hillbilly. You Peloponessian dirtbag.
Each time you are seperate with Eleni"...

26
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,580
..."don't we have to put up with her along with your kids and your mother?" 
- I didn't tell him Panos because he is right.

27
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,960
You know how hard it is to take 
nine kids to the beach each day...

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,300
...to shop for sixteen people, 
to take the seniors to the swings?

29
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,020
- He takes the seniors to the swings?! 
- Along with the kids.

30
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,780
Of course, the seniors don't swing but they enjoy watching 
and during the evening they want to have hamburgers at the square.

31
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,380
If it was me, I would have killed someone. 
- Let him kill his mother!

32
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,000
You know what she told me on Easter when I cut some kokoretsi for her?

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,920
"Come to Padaditsa and see 
how real kokoretsi tastes like."

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,880
- Indeed, in Papaditsa the kokoretsi is out of this world.

35
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,600
- Out of this world?

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,220
You know what a professional from Kalamata told me?

37
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,260
I ask him...

38
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,400
..."How come Mr. Marmatzeas is the kokoretsi in Padaditsa so delicious?"...

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
...And he replies tete a tete...

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,240
..."Because in Papaditsa they don't wash the entrails".

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,320
- That means we are eating...

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,060
- Grilled shit with mustard and pepper...

43
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,320
...that's what we are eating!

44
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,400
Because...

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
...look at what God did.

46
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,380
He creates three sisters.

47
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,020
I take the first, all right.

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,160
You take the next. All right.

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,920
And then comes he during the PASOK pre-congress...

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
...And marries the youngest. 
- That's how we became brothers-in-law.

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,960
- Yes! But, what have I ever done...

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,680
...to become family with an alderman 
from Papaditsa, Lakonia?

53
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't stop...

54
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,840
Stop. Stop!

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,640
Sir, I'm afraid we made a mistake.

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
How may I help you?

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,460
Sir, I'm afraid we made a mistake.

58
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,560
It is human to err.

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,540
I was told that, in order to reach Kavala...

60
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,460
...the sea must be on my right.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
And where is the sea?

62
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,520
On my left.

63
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,520
Is that your dad?

64
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,160
Your heading is correct...

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,760
...when you reach Asprovalta, the sea will be on your right...

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,620
...this is lake Volvi.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,020
Have you ever bathed in the Lake?

68
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,960
- No.

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Under the moonlight, the nymphs emerge.

70
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
- It must be magical.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
- Magic...

72
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,140
- This must certainly be the place where the historical Volvi Congress took place...

73
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,520
- I'm not sure.

74
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,600
- They say that, this congress was a watershed...

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,880
...and influenced the political scene.

76
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,560
- Maybe. 
- I thank you nevertheless.

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,700
We should come one evening...

78
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,580
...Mister?

79
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Panagiotis. My friends call me "Panos".

80
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,220
...Mr. Panos told me

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
...that, under the full moon the nymphs emerge...

82
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,780
...and bathe in the water.

83
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,220
Again, I thank you.

84
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,600
You see what God does?

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,420
Creating creatures like that 
and then unleashing them upon the world.

86
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,760
And He does not care if He takes my breath away.

87
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,500
So, what do I do now?

88
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,360
It came as a bit of a suprise, Panos...

89
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,880
...But until we reach the ferry, 
we'll have forgotten all about her.

90
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,640
Well, I'm not forgetting her!

91
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,660
Time is a doctor, Panos. He passes and he obscures everything.

92
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Now you must preoccupy yourself with other things
and remove her from your thoughts.

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,360
<i>Get out of my thought...</i>

94
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,680
<i>...everything that is you hurts...</i>

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,960
<i>...since you are living with someone else.</i>

96
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
<i>I don't need anything...</i>

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,700
<i>...what are you looking for anymore...</i>

98
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,740
<i>...and are still torturing me?</i>

99
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,800
<i>Get out of my head...</i>

100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
<i>...the wounds are not enough for you...</i>

101
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,400
<i>...that I touch and it hurts...</i>

102
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,820
<i>...Get out of my head.</i>

103
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>Get out! Get out! Get out!</i>

104
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,860
<i>Get out of my head...</i>

105
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,220
<i>...the wounds are not enough for you...</i>

106
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,780
<i>...that because of you I count...</i>

107
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,380
<i>Get out of my head...</i>

108
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,600
<i>Get out! Get out! Get out!</i>

109
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,800
- Panos, I think it would be better if we drank our coffee in Kavala. 
- I'll drink it wherever I want to drink it!

110
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,160
And if someone calls saying we are late
I will also have something to say about his momma.

111
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,740
Good day.

112
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,720
 Something's on your mind.

113
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Didn't you get what happened?

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,320
The girl tells him "let's come 
during a full moon night"...

115
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
..."the Sir told me", while pointing at me...

116
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,640
...and I say "Panagiotis"...

117
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,800
..."My friends call me Panos"...

118
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,280
...and the girl says...

119
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,620
..."Mr. <i>Panos</i> told me..."...

120
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,780
You got it?

121
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,120
- Get what?
-Get what?! She didn't say "Mr. Panagiotis"...

122
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,820
...she said "Mr. <i>Panos</i>".

123
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
- Are you getting it now?
-No.

124
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,900
Doesn't matter. Because <i>he</i> got it.

125
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,280
...and when he hears "Mr. <i>Panos</i> told me"...

126
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,600
...he thinks to himself "this is getting serious"
and he steps on the gas pedal and zooms away.

127
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,680
Indeed, he left in a hurry.

128
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,540
So, think first, understand, and then say 
"I don't understand"!

129
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,780
Frappé, ice cold, two spoons of sugar.

130
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,240
The same, no sugar.

131
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Panos, Frappé with no sugar is poison.

132
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,780
I'll do whatever I want!

133
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,800
<i>Don't say a word...</i>

134
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,700
<i>...just let me go...</i>

135
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,900
- We are listening to the same song. 
- Of course.

136
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,400
And <i>he</i> knows we are listening to the same song.

137
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Who Panos?

138
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,280
<i>...empty words that you are used to saying.</i>

139
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
<i>...and don't speak...</i>

140
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,440
- Excuse me.
- Good day.
- Good day...

141
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,760
...is this a radio?

142
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,240
CD.

143
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,680
<i>...don't tell me, don't tell me...</i>

144
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,640
<i>...that you'll rebuild what you destroyed...</i>

145
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,220
<i>Don't speak, don't speak...</i>

146
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,980
<i>...only with words...</i>

147
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,980
Panos?

148
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,920
Panos?

149
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,440
She shows herself, right?

150
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,840
And she tells me, let's go...

151
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
...and it's like my life restarts.

152
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,480
Panos...

153
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
...I'm picturing the girl coming 
and telling you "let's go"...

154
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,300
...do you put her in the truck 
and you go?

155
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,200
And she gets black from the filth 
from head to toe?

156
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,860
Why aren't you answering?

157
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,800
- Because, I'm waiting to see 
where you are getting with this. 
- I'm not trying to get anywhere...

158
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,320
...I'm just making logical assumptions.

159
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,660
You are going to have to buy a new car. 
Not a Mercedes...

160
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,320
...but certainly a convertible. 
Ten million.

161
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,300
Where are you going to take her? 
Are you going to rent a tiny room in Thasos?

162
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,100
Of course not.

163
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,500
A suite in Porto Carras.

164
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,640
In the evening she will want to go to the casino.

165
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,840
...and if she is on a streak, OK.

166
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,760
But if not?

167
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,140
Are you the one to tell her "play prudently" or will you tell her "go on, I got you"?

168
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,420
I'll tell her "go on, I got you".

169
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
And then summer is over...

170
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,520
...and for the winter you go to Thessaloniki...

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,600
...you will rent a penthouse in Panorama for her...

172
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
...and you will eat in the fine restaurants.

173
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,640
You have left a wife and three kids a sick sister and an old father behind you.

174
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,080
They are hungry...

175
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,660
...and you are eating in Pringkiponisos...

176
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,820
...and suddenly you see Fotoula and Dionisakis...

177
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,360
...and they are begging at the tables...

178
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,540
...What do you do at that moment? 
- I throw a rope and hang myself!

179
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,380
This girl must come from around Phaliro or Glyfada
and you take her with on Sunday 
on a match against Olympiacos...

180
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,240
...and Ivić dives in the penalty area, 
and the Anchovies shout for a penalty shot...

181
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,060
...and she is shouting for a penalty too.

182
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,240
What will you do in front of the PAOK fans, lifelong fan? 
- I kill her!

183
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,080
I know you, that is why I theorize.

184
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,080
And, to come back to economical matters...

185
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,300
...what will you do when the car payments are due...

186
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,840
...the bouncing checks from the boutiques, the jewelry stores, 
the night clubs, the florists, the restaurants?

187
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,840
The girl herself, to save you will say 
"Panos, that's it for us".

188
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,380
And you, hurt, alone, one morning you will 
present yourself to the prosecutor.

189
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,060
The sentence will be fifteen years, 
this being your first offense.

190
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,120
One morning the gate will open and you will exit the prison.

191
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,260
You will look down towards Thessaloniki.

192
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,940
Your children will be rehabilitated. 
Marika will be living with someone else.

193
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,180
Your father is dead and your sister is 
incarcerated in some asylum.

194
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,060
And you will walk down to the White Tower...

195
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:07,140
...you will take a stroll but no one 
will welcome you or greet you.

196
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,040
Because, people do not forgive those who 
due to love have fallen!

197
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,560
- Oh, my God!
- Panos! Panos!

198
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,560
Panos, what in God's name did you do?!

199
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,440
Miss, your name?

200
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,860
- Clytemnestra.
- Ms. Clytemnestra, this same thing...

201
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,340
...has happened to him two more times in the past.
- He trows himself in the lake?

202
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,590
No, in the sea. Once in the Messiniakos and 
once in the Pagasitikos bays.

203
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,540
- For the same reason?
- For... a similar reason.

204
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,690
Let him drink a bitter coffee and take a warm shower and 
then I'll take his blood-pressure, OK?

205
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,860
Thank you a lot.

206
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,620
Panos, sometimes we wonder
"for which of our sins did God create women?"

207
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,640
But, I'm thinking now, 
a woman destroyed you...

208
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,060
...but it is also women who saved you.

209
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,180
We wish for you always to be well.

210
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,460
- Always in good health!
- Amen! 
- Thank you.

211
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,500
- Farewell.
- Thank you very much.

212
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,820
- Get well soon.
- Thank you.

213
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

214
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,600
How are you feeling?

215
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Getting better...

216
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,640
No!

217
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,920
But, the doctoresses told me to drink bitter coffee.

218
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,200
Yeah, that's what they said Panos.

219
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,160
But, when I explained your situation a bit better they said 
"better add four spoons of sugar".

220
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,920
- What situation are you talking about exactly?
- Your situation, Panos.

221
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,440
But, instead of telling them about love et cetera, 
I told them that sometimes...

222
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,100
...you develop a kind of obstruction in your heart.
- And what did they say?

223
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,880
They were touched.

224
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,640
Of course, they are doctoresses
and they understood about what kind of obstruction I was talking about.

225
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,020
Because one of them said "God, why can't things like that happen to me as well".

226
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,580
- Things like what?
- How should I know? Things...

227
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,100
Drink so your blood sugar goes up a bit, get some strength into you.

228
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,900
- I feel regret.
- No Panos, it's not your fault.

229
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
I am paying for my mistakes.

230
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,000
-...Life is at fault for laying out traps for us.
- Because, when he says...

231
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
..."I was told, to get to Kavala 
the sea must be on my right"...

232
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,420
...I should have told him "that's true, turn back and it will be on your right"...

233
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,960
- Would you direct him the wrong way Panagiotis?
- Of course I would.

234
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,520
He would have reached Platamonas and the girl would have told him...

235
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,380
..."Lakis, the sea is on the left again."

236
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,740
Let's assume his name is Lakis.

237
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,960
He would have gotten out the car, would have asked again and would have been told "turn back my good man"...

238
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,680
..."to go to Kavala the sea must be on your right."

239
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,180
The imbecile would have turned 
again and past Thessaloniki...

240
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,520
...at the Volvi lake, the sea would be on his left yet again.

241
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,620
- We should have fooled him like that Panagiotis.
- Yeah, but then you jump in and say...

242
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,720
..."in Asprovalta the sea will be on your right". 
Why would you do such a thing?!

243
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,580
- Because, people like us Panagiotis do not 
wish evil even to their enemies. 
- Well, I do!

244
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,140
Make him travel back and forth from Platamonas to Volvi 
half a dozen times until he gets crazy, the fool!

245
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,560
We are nice people. We don't wish evil to anyone 
and everyone steps on our throat.

246
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,020
Regret. I feel regret!

247
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,860
<i>I regret it all. I regret it all.</i>

248
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,900
<i>And it's all because of my egoism.</i>

249
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,780
<i>I regret it all. I regret it all.</i>

250
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,660
<i>Now, I pay for my mistakes.</i>

251
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,300
<i>I regret it all. I regret it all.</i> 
Don't pick up!

252
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,180
Antonis? Panos had a sudden malaise. He was feeling down and 
his blood sugar got low. We will be in Kavala...

253
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,820
...in an hour, with the ferry we will be on Thasos at around three or four.

254
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,680
What the hell are you telling him? I could be sitting here with a blood-pressure in the low twenties.

255
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,880
- I'm not going anywhere without a doctor taking a look at me first.
 - We can't leave. Yes, there are two doctoresses here.

256
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,880
- What you are saying Antonis? How can you even think of such a thing?!
- What this Arcadian shepherd...

257
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,640
...the Peloponessian dirtbag saying? Is he looking in a mirror?

258
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,940
Explain what Antonis? Someone got lost, we tried to help he and he says...

259
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,400
..."it was here where the historical congress of Volvi took place"...

260
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,760
...and I tell him "I'm not sure". And then Panos got 
involved and they started fighting.

261
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,620
Yes Antonis! Because of the congress.

262
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,340
- He won't believe us even if we swear on the Bible.
- What did he tell you?

263
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,860
- He asked me "since when is Panos involved in politics?". And I tell him...

264
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,800
..."politics never gave us anything."

265
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,160
If we don't work there is no PASOK to feed us.

266
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,300
Well said! And you hang up on him too.

267
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,680
I didn't hang up, he did. "Because" he said...

268
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,020
..."I'm not paying for the mobile line to listen to your bullshit".

269
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,880
Filthy mouth! Filth!

270
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,480
- Good day.
 - Good day.

271
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,060
- Good day too you.
 - Good day.

272
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,840
Lift your right sleeve please.

273
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,300
But... I'm alright.

274
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,420
- The tent turned out nicely, thank you.
 - Oh, it was nothing.

275
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,420
You see Miss, I was in the Engineer Corps.

276
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,720
- We would build a bridge in one day.
- One day?

277
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,280
- Yes. And when the army passed, 
we would tear it down again.
- Why?

278
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,080
So that the enemy would not pass as well.

279
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,860
- Twelve over eight.
- Your brother in law has the blood pressure of a teenager.

280
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,680
So, you are leaving?

281
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,740
Well, yes. The family is waiting you see.

282
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,100
- Good day.
- Good day.

283
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,140
- Good day.
- Good day.

284
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,840
You got away with it Panos,
but I shouldn't have stopped.

285
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,300
When you saw the girl and yelled "stop" 
I should have stepped on the gas.

286
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,940
- As if it was her fault.
- She caused your destabilization.

287
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,500
Get to your senses!

288
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,980
It was he who destabilized me!

289
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,040
Because he wants to trap us. So that we take care of the 
seniors while he goes spearfishing.

290
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,180
- Indeed, he might have thought of that.
- Yes, but what he has not thought of
 is that I might get crazy...

291
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,580
...and throttle his mommy at the central square.

292
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,090
- Is that radio?
 - CD.
 - Again, good day to you.


293
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,680
Panos, leave Antonis to God.

294
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
We need to get back to our families.

295
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,250
He will sail and he will ask the strangers...

296
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,850
..."have you seen my brothers in law?" And no one will know to tell him.

297
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,020
And he will come back alone, like a dog.

298
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
I will destroy his mental health!

299
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,200
- Panos, he will send Marika and Georgia to sail to take revenge.
- Our wives?!
- Yes Panos.

300
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,310
And they will ask the strangers and no one will know to tell them.

301
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,890
And they will go home at midnight and the children will cry...

302
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,740
...and he will laugh in secret and his mental health will be just fine.
- You think he will play us like that?

303
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,560
Panos, Antonis grew up in PASOK, that's like PASOK 101.

304
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,070
But, Panagiotis, sometimes I think he is not that bad...

305
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,050
...he works all day for the Party and at night he sells olive oil...

306
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,050
...and during the weekend he reads.

307
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,220
- Who works like that?
- He cakes up though!

308
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,600
He does cake up but he also lends us a lot and 
we always say "you'll get it next month".

309
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,940
- Yeah, so what? Is he not going to get it?
- He is, but we are behind...

310
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,470
...and, we also said to ask for a new loan...

311
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,560
...and we will pay the grand sum.
- Better for him...

312
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,540
...because if he gets it all at once, he will invest it in one place and make an impact.

313
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,270
Small sums have no impact!

314
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:54,180
One night I went to his office. I saw him, and 
you must believe me Panos, I saw him 
sitting alone on the chair.

315
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,380
And I thought to myself "this man might be destined for something greater".

316
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,960
It's coming again...

317
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,340
- What is coming Panos?
- The thought of her...

318
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,200
...I'm trying to get her out of my head, but she is coming.

319
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,580
How is it coming Panagiotis?

320
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
- I see her in front of me, looking at me.
- Looking at you?

321
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,600
Yes. Now I turn my head...

322
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,580
...and, normally, there should be the lake...

323
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
...well, I don't see any lake!
- You can't see the lake!?

324
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,740
There's a whole lake there and you can't see it?!
- No.
- What do you see?

325
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,420
I see her!

326
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,020
Well, that's it! We are going nowhere! You will sleep for five hours at least...

327
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,470
...with Ms. Doctor I will find a nice fish...

328
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,470
...a catfish or a carp...

329
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,180
...and grill it with lemon and oil. You will get up...

330
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,200
...and you will eat to regain your strength and then at dusk...

331
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
...we will go find our families.

332
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,360
[SONG] <i>I am chuffed...</i>

333
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,290
Am I chuffed?
- No Mr. Panos.

334
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,200
So?

335
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,040
Michalis.

336
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Yes Panos.

337
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,710
Come every five minutes and check on me.

338
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,710
Why must I come Panagiotis?

339
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,910
To check if I'm still alive.

340
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,760
[SONG] <i>Again, you'll see love as a prison.</i>

341
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:32,540
<i>And you will wonder about those teary eyes.</i>

342
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,540
<i>Again, you'll leave and run like mad.</i>

343
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,850
Antonis, yes Antonis...

344
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,850
...I called to say the following.

345
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,400
Because, the situation is grave and I can't manage by myself.

346
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,870
We argued because about the Congress, how many times must I tell you?

347
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,360
And we are arguing about the Congress...

348
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,650
...and he has a girl with him. And Panos starts speaking with her...

349
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,050
...and the guy gets mad...

350
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,490
...and he takes her and they leave.

351
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,340
And that cost Panos dearly.

352
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,890
What can I say? Should I say that we are losing him?

353
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:14,140
<i>And I try, to forget you I try.</i>

354
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,620
<i>There is no place where I can cry.</i>

355
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,840
I must introduce you to an important scientist...

356
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,220
...Professor Petseropoulos, lecturer of Psychology 
at the University of Washington.

357
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
Nice to meet you.

358
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,110
Nice to meet you.

359
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,870
Mr. Michalis, on behalf of the KAPI of Makedonia and Thrace...

360
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,780
...we congratulate you for fishing a hundred kilos worth of fish.

361
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,270
We ran into a school.

362
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,780
We also congratulate you about the quality of the meal.

363
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,510
We drink towards the rapid restoration of your brother-in-law's health.

364
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,450
We drink towards the good health of the bathers.

365
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,090
Fish!

366
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,110
Right away Panos, it's getting de-boned. You regained
your appetite...

367
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,180
 ...and that is a
sign that you are getting better.

368
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,420
Don't worry about your relative.

369
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,510
He is just showing symptoms of a simple
impulse control disorder.
- I see...

370
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,020
For example, a man falls in love with a woman...

371
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,140
...will he destroy himself in her charm or will he control the impulse?

372
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,780
He will control the impulse.

373
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,340
Well done! Bravo!

374
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,400
During the first stage, that person will lose his sight.

375
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,910
He does Professor.

376
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,760
Because he says "the lake should be here but I can't see it" and I tell him...

377
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,470
...the lake is right there and you can't see it Panos?
- He can't.

378
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,490
He only sees the face of the woman who is leading him to destruction.

379
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,580
To save himself he must drown her in the lake.

380
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,470
If not her, then any woman.

381
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,620
Dear Lord!

382
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,580
Dr. Sylvia is asking if you are going to use the multiplication-table method.

383
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,050
Exactly.

384
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:58,000
I will start with with the higher scale of nine-by-nine and I'll go down from there.

385
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
If he does not answer three-by-three correctly...

386
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,110
- What happens then Professor?
- Then unfortunately...

387
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,910
- He has a family.
- Let's start from the middle.

388
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,380
Ask him please. Five-by-five.

389
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,070
Panos!

390
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,110
Fish!

391
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,110
But, Mr. Panos.

392
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,540
It's getting de-boned Panos, patience.

393
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,870
Five-by-five?

394
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,870
Forty!

395
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,620
<i>Not good at all.</i>

396
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,980
- Oh God.
- Do not despair.

397
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,490
Four-by-four.

398
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,490
Panos! Four-by-four?

399
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,820
Eighteen!

400
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,200
<i>Better, better. He is getting close.</i>

401
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,690
- A bit better.
- And now...

402
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,140
...the critical three-by-three.

403
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,140
Panos.

404
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,670
Three times three?

405
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,600
Nine!

406
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,910
Thank you! Thank's a lot!

407
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:01,020
Music! Music!

408
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,080
[SONG] <i>Whoever told you that I learned...</i>

409
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,760
<i>...to live without you is a liar.</i>

410
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,050
<i>I'm living a nightmare. Dreams like wounds.</i>

411
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,670
<i>I bring in my mind all moments...</i>

412
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,560
<i>...where I wanted you to come and see.</i>

413
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,360
<i>Please don't deny me that.</i>

414
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,310
<i>Come and find me.</i>

415
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,890
<i>Just to see...</i>

416
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,820
<i>..how my life is like and feel sorry for me.</i>

417
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
<i>Come and find me...</i>

418
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,560
When you got under the van and lifted the bell I thought...

419
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,200
..."This man is taking care of three children
 a wife, a father, a sick sister"...

420
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,780
..."me, his friends, PAOK..."

421
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,490
"...and how does life repai him? With breadcrumbs."

422
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,290
...that's what I said.
- Leave me alone.

423
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,450
A day will come when life will be different.

424
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,940
We won't exist until then but that's all right.

425
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,940
It's enough that they will remember us.

426
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,380
They will remember that we were alive once.

427
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,220
Pour him something so that he shuts up.

428
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,880
[SONG] <i>Whoever told you that I learned...</i>

429
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,450
<i>...to live without you is a liar.</i>

430
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,000
<i>Thoughts like stabs in my heart</i>

431
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,580
We will start the business for the women.

432
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,890
If they make their own money they won't pay any attention to us.

433
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,890
And we will live a life we never imagined.

434
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,180
They told me "Psomiadis is sucking you dry" and Eleni said...

435
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,180
..."your children don't have a shirt to change."

436
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,580
- What did Eleni say?!
- She is enabling our women Panos.

437
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,540
Why didn't you say "Antonis is bringing in the dough day and night, how can you be ungrateful?"

438
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,050
I did Panos. And she said "If Antonis had any brains he would not break his back for the Party..."

439
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,600
..."he would be a minister like Tzoumakas."

440
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,890
- Isn't she going to Italy to buy clothes?
- Is Thessaloniki too small to shop in?

441
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,360
And the idiot still pays!

442
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,960
If things were right this man would be sanctified.

443
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,820
Panos, my mind stopped working.

444
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Do you happen to know how much six times six is?

445
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,110
- Thirty-six.
- Seven times seven?
- Fifty-nine.

446
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,540
<i>Come and find me to see how my life is like.</i>

447
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,940
 <i>And feel sorry for me.</i>

448
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:48,090
<i>Come and find me and maybe you will think about...</i>

449
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,650
<i>...how I am dying alone if you don't come back.</i>

450
00:32:51,680 --> 00:33:06,540
<i>How I am dying alone if you don't come back.</i>
<i>How I am dying alone if you don't come back.</i>
<i>How I am dying alone... Come and find me.</i>

451
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,360
Is there a refectory here?

452
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,760
Yes, but it's not open yet.

453
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,910
As you can see, it's dawn and we are alone.

454
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,320
Do you want some music, maybe?

455
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,620
Do you have the "Carmina Burana"?

456
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,160
We have Angela, Kaitoula Garmpi...

457
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
No!

458
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,310
Alright. We came early because Mr. Panos...

459
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,310
...wants to hear music the moment he wakes up.

460
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,310
Oh really?

461
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,540
And what kind of music does Mr. Panos request?

462
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,820
He prefers Mr. Melas, Mr. Sfakianakis and Mr. Karras.

463
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,670
Because something happened to him that touched his psyche.

464
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,020
What touched his psyche?

465
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,560
They say, maybe, his unrequited love for a young lady.

466
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,270
That young lady is showing herself in front of him and leads him to destruction.

467
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,820
To destruction?

468
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,650
To save himself he must drown her in the lake.

469
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,650
The young lady?

470
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:57,340
Yes. And if not her, any other woman.

471
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,540
But the women here are not afraid, right Archontoula?

472
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,250
Because...

473
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,620
Because?

474
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:13,070
Because Mr. Panos will drown the mother of his brother-in-law!

475
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,440
I'm at odds with myself!

476
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,720
He is awake! He is awake!

477
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:43,720
<i>I'm at odds with myself for still loving you.</i>

478
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:51,600
<i>And my Ego is like trash on the street.</i>

479
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,250
<i>I'm at odds with myself for still loving you.</i>

480
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,580
Antonis, have you been here long? Why didn't you wake us up?

481
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,980
So, that's how it is Mr. Panos, you want to drown my mother in the lake?

482
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,850
- What is he talking about?
- Why don't you drown yourself?

483
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,620
Leave us alone you redneck! You hick!
- ...to do something good for mankind.

484
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,580
Peloponnesian filth! We let you wander around and you steal the peoples bread!

485
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,560
Antonis, Panos knows nothing about drownings. Mr. Professor said those things.

486
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,890
- Who is that professor?
- Lecturer at the Washington University!

487
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,110
 - Those guys could drive even a psychiatrist crazy. 
Who am I to put up with them?

488
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,640
Can you tell me what exactly happened?

489
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
We passed his car as we were supposed to...

490
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,210
...but he has stopped in the meantime.

491
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,340
We get out and he says
 "This where the historic Volvi summit was held."

492
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,960
And I tell him "I'm not really sure".

493
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,160
This guy is clueless about historical matters.
 This is not where the summit was held.

494
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,690
Says who?! You?

495
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,810
Panos, in the Party they ask Panos
 about historical matters.

496
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:51,060
Remember what Castanides said?
 Antonis is PAOK's Paparigopoulos.

497
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,490
In 1979 in Cassandra, Chalkidiki...

498
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,110
...the second New Democracy summit was held.

499
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,110
Like we give a fuck.

500
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,110
Miday, on the 5th of March,
 the Party youths had fish here.

501
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,560
After the meal...

502
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
...the then youth party member Vanggelis Meimarakis...

503
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,390
...read a proclamation.

504
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,640
The proclamation read that New Democracy...

505
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,260
...must transform itself from a 
 leader-based to a principle-based party.

506
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,140
This movement, known as the Volvi Movement...

507
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,710
...was to play a crucial role in future developments.

508
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,490
Hold on a second...
 Didn't you say they stayed in Cassandra?

509
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,690
Yes, in Cassandra.

510
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,390
Then why did they eat here
 and brought Volvi into the mix?

511
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,940
This hasn't been clarified.

512
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,840
You should have asked for an explanation.

513
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,110
Ask for an explanation?
 But they are the same!

514
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,440
PASOK and New Democracy?!

515
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,540
Two faces of the same coin!

516
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,890
I feel sorry for you!

517
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,940
In Cassandra you piss, in Volvi you take the piss!

518
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,910
Every time we have a serious discussion,
 you fuck it up!

519
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,910
- I fuck it up?!
- You!

520
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,190
And you mock Michails, who has made 
a myriad sacrifices for you!

521
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,660
Can you give us like, one example?

522
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,290
When the police saw the video 
and were looking to arrest you...

523
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,460
...didn't Michalis take your place 
and say that he did it?

524
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,090
And they said "Are you kidding?"...

525
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,490
"It's obvious you are just pushing your
brother-in-law back, so that he doesn't throttle the referee!"

526
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,460
And he says "Yes, I am pushing him and so he has to keep balance by grabbing the referees neck".

527
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,990
- Was the ref payed off?
- Did he award you with two penalty shots?

528
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,760
Is it the refs fault 
if you get scored on thrice?

529
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,560
- Was there a score reversal at the last minute?
- Three meters from the penalty box?!

530
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,990
Are you kidding me?
 Manolas tackles Skartados...

531
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,640
...sends him airborne for three meters...

532
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,090
...and falls in the penatly box!
 - He was faking it!

533
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,840
And the boy is lying half-dead in the mud,
and the refs shows him the yellow card...

534
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,090
...as if he is faking it? And he still has a heartbeat!?

535
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,840
As if we were waiting for the Laconian farmers 
to come and teach us what a penalty is...

536
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,040
- Was it a penalty Mr. Panos?
- Miss, it was the <i>definition</i> of a penalty!

537
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,010
But Thessaloniki must install a customs office!

538
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,090
Where was your passport issued mister? 
In Laconia? No entry!

539
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,840
No entry!

540
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,260
No entry!

541
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,210
Antonis, I am afraid. Since the doctors said that 
Myrto must be committed to the psychiatric hospital...

542
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,360
...he sits still in the smith shop for hours on end.

543
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
What happened with the girl?

544
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,060
We passed his car as we were supposed 
to and he gets out of the Mercedes.

545
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,740
I tell him "Panos, stop".

546
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,010
Even I, who was not affected that much, 
felt my knees getting weak on her sight.

547
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,560
- Was she really that beautiful?
- Beautiful?

548
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,310
I am telling you, she might not even be from this world.

549
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,160
And from which world was she?

550
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
I don't know...

551
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
God...

552
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,320
[SONG] <i>I packed and I'm leaving the old one...</i>

553
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,410
[SONG] <i>...I'm moving my love to a man from Thessaloniki</i>

554
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,360
Panos! Leave the poor man be.

555
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,360
He is just as tortured as you are.

556
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,860
What are you talking about?

557
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,390
If I let "the tortured one" be, 
we will have five extra mouths to feed.

558
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,390
It doesn't really look like anything serious.

559
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,940
Not serious?

560
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,460
Even I am struggling with women issues...

561
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,540
...and you think the redneck will get away with it?

562
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,240
Truth be told, you are quite the Don Juan, Panos.

563
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
See?

564
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,640
We'll get them Panos.

565
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,440
This guy has a kid in Germany and another one in Sweden.

566
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,890
If he gets close to a woman, 
 she is eating for two in no time.

567
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,060
You think that Clytemnestra is at risk as well?

568
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,360
Her? She will get knocked up by touching alone.

569
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,660
Antonis!

570
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,660
May we have a moment?

571
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,790
Antonis!

572
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,520
- Well?
- Well...

573
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Like you said this morning...

574
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
...if we understood correctly...

575
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,520
...you proposed that we leave...

576
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
...go take care of the elderly...

577
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
...and take care of you momma as well...

578
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,960
- Correct.
 - And you...

579
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,040
...tomorrow or, the latest the day after that, you board the ferry and come as well.

580
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,940
Exactly.

581
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,640
May I ask a question?

582
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,590
- Sure.
- Are you being serious?

583
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,860
It's just a friendly relationship, Panos.
 Just a summertime friendship.

584
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,790
OK. So if you see her during 
winter on Tsimiski street...

585
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,790
...you will take a left on Komninon street.

586
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,790
Well, no. I will say hello...

587
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,290
...what's new, and so on.

588
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,160
You might even sit and have a coffee?

589
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,660
Why not? We are friends after all.

590
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:39,290
Panos is asking if, beyond this 
friendship there are any feelings?

591
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,610
Sure there are feelings. Man has feelings.

592
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,740
This is what seperates him from beast and plant.

593
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,460
There it is!

594
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,360
Let's make it clear then.

595
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,710
Are you in love?

596
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,710
Or are you just trying to tap-and-run her?

597
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,260
Antonis! Panos! Michalis!

598
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,560
Clytemnestra!

599
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,790
What do you mean "tap-and-run"?

600
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,440
Wasn't that part of PASOK 101?

601
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,060
Panos, leave PASOK out of this.

602
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,890
What does PASOK have to do with feelings?

603
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,510
Isn't he favored to lead?

604
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,060
If he makes it onto the MP list, of course.

605
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,060
And they didn't teach him the basics?
 Is this how he is going to lead the people?

606
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,200
Well?

607
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,740
I took care of three families.

608
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,310
Now it's your turn.

609
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,110
We either go all or no one.

610
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,340
- No one!
- No one!

611
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,600
<i>Love that became fire...</i>

612
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,440
<i>...a lit cigarette...</i>

613
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,410
<i>...from your ashes yet again, I burn and die.</i>

614
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,360
<i>Love that became fire...</i>

615
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,860
<i>...a lit cigarette...</i>

616
00:47:52,860 --> 00:48:00,090
<i>...from your ashes yet again, I burn and die.</i>

617
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,590
Do we have a rope?

618
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,660
We do Panos, but what do we need it for?

619
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,660
To tie him up.

620
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,810
Who? Antonis?

621
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,540
I'll play nice to lure him in. You come from behind...

622
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,940
When I say the phrase "your momma". 
Remember, "your momma"...

623
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,940
...you tie him up.

624
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,960
Tie up Antonis?

625
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,110
Who else?

626
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,940
There will be three wives waiting 
and there is going to be only two of us?

627
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,010
- This is not good.
- Well?

628
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:58,240
When his wife asks you what you did 
with her husband, what will you say?

629
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,860
That you left him with his mistress?

630
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,160
- Can you understand the issue you create?
- <i>I</i> create?

631
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,160
Well, who creates it then?

632
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,040
It's all "me, me, me".

633
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,200
Don't pick up.

634
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,790
It might be Antonis calling because he is feeling regret, Panos.

635
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,390
Eleni? We are starting in ten minutes.

636
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,960
We are missing for two days?

637
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,060
Here they say the had a summit 
and try to fool everyone.

638
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,360
There was no summit.

639
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,490
But Antonis rebuked them and 
it will become a political issue.

640
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,190
That joke of a man.

641
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,190
Panos...

642
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,190
Eleni asks if we want the veal with tomato 
sauce or with baked potatoes.

643
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,190
Tomato sauce.

644
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,910
With tomato sauce and fried potatoes.

645
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,440
Make sure to fry a bunch.

646
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,290
Antonis wants a lot of popatoes.

647
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,210
As you know, he only eats the potatoes
 and does not even touch the veal.

648
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,390
Alright...

649
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,860
I'll tie you up and deliver you to your wive like an Amazon package.

650
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,860
You joke of a man.

651
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,240
Follow them!

652
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,740
What do you see?

653
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,010
He is forcing her.

654
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,310
In broad daylight?!

655
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,840
- What "in broad daylight"?
- He is forcing her in broad daylight?

656
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,210
Is that what I just said?

657
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,210
"He is forcing her", that's what you said.

658
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,710
She does not want to eat a banana...

659
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,340
...and he is forcing her to eat a banana.

660
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,860
That's what I said!

661
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,880
She will gold-dig him for at least five hundred thousands.

662
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,040
Women in our age have their price, Panos.

663
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,340
You need at least fifteen just for drinks.

664
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,990
- Fifteen for <i>one</i> drink?
 - Well, not one drink...

665
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:14,040
...but Vanggelis's girl drank three shots, going for a fourth...

666
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,040
...and he says "what do we owe?"...

667
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,810
...and orders three more shots on top of that.
The tab is at three thousand.

668
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,890
He pays and says "I'll go out and smoke".

669
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,310
She keeps on drinking. When dawn comes 
she has no money to pay and is in trouble.

670
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,840
They ask "where is the guy who was with you?"...

671
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,610
And she says "I don't know, I just met him tonight"...

672
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,760
And thus Vanggelis got out of paying thirty thousand extra.

673
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,840
What was the point of this story?

674
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,290
Because Panos, I was thinking...

675
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,290
When Vaggelis was sick for thirty days...

676
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,290
...fifteen thousands divided by...

677
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,320
Panos! Michalis!

678
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,140
Clytemnestra! Antonis!

679
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,540
Follow them! Follow them!

680
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,090
Last we saw them in Olympiada.

681
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,260
In Arnea they told us they saw them having coffee.

682
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,890
Which means they didn't head to Hagion Oros.

683
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,840
- Great job Sherlock.
 - We eliminiated one peninsula.

684
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,740
- Now it's your turn to choose.
- Did you choose?

685
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,290
I chose one out of three peninsulas.

686
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
Arnea...

687
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,740
Ormylia...

688
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,160
Nikiti...

689
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
Marmaras...

690
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,210
Porto Caras!

691
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,440
That joke of a man!

692
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,440
He thought he could escape me.

693
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,560
- Good evening.
- Hello.

694
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,640
Jack Daniels. Make one of them a double.

695
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,290
You fool. Can't you see how life is?

696
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:58,190
Become a minister to get the 
dough and help us too.

697
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,040
We thought you will make it big...

698
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,710
...and we will live a better life 
but you are running behind women.

699
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,190
Idiot...

700
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,690
Panos, who are you talking to?

701
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,960
Well then I will make it big on my own!

702
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,660
We will work. We have a lot of comissions.

703
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,260
Mr. Psomiadis said the other day "Be prepared for work..."

704
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,010
"...and in ten years the situation will be different."

705
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,490
I will make them suffer.

706
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:18,490
We don't want to harm anyone.

707
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,940
Bet everything on thirty-six red.

708
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,940
You don't mean, we will gamble, right?

709
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,510
We got to here and won't gamble?

710
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,910
We don't have money Panos. 
If Antonis does not lend us we are in dire straights.

711
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,660
Next month we have to pay...

712
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,040
...two rents, insurance...

713
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,660
...phone and power bills. Income tax.

714
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,740
We have to buy raw metal. Clothes for the kids.

715
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,740
Stuff for the household.

716
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,740
Take a look at this miser.

717
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,460
Why are you reminding me of all this?

718
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,090
Do you know what I have been through?

719
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,210
- What happened to you?
 - When we were coming I said...

720
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,810
...Panagiotis, if you see a dog on 
a motorcycle, take it as a sign.

721
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,860
Did we or did we not see the sign?

722
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,960
I saw no sign, just a motorcycle 
with four dogs running after it.

723
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,760
Well, motorcycle and dog, that was the sign.

724
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,940
Four dogs? Even better.

725
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,690
But why thirty-six red? We have no sign for that.

726
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,090
What was the weather like on St. Antons even
 when we lit the forge?

727
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,390
- Snowstorm.
- Did the door open and you asked who it was?

728
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,540
I did Panos because I got scared...

729
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,410
...the door was loked from the inside, how did it open?

730
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,290
- Did we see a woman?
- She was tall and slim and...

731
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,210
...she ordered thirty-six candleholders.

732
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,760
Did she sign the check as "Joan Pappos, Nevada"?

733
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,760
- We cashed it.
- Did she ever come for the candleholders?

734
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,360
No, and we had to sell them.

735
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,860
Did they say that that night, 
many saw the Holy Mother...

736
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,360
...and a lame guy got healed?

737
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,160
As did a woman in Kalamaria.

738
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
So?

739
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,210
Your bets please.

740
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,740
Why the hell are you betting everything on black? To jinx me?

741
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,240
To have a second out, Panos.

742
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,760
No more bets please.

743
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,540
Seventeen, black.

744
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,400
 No more bets please.

745
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,990
 Seventeen, black.

746
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,990
Répétition.

747
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,920
No more bets please.

748
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,710
Will you look at the imbecile betting on 36 red?

749
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,710
Not even we could pull this off.

750
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,840
36 red.

751
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,360
That's motherfucking it! I'm voting for PASOK!

752
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,000
Your bets please.

753
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,140
 Even if I tell you Panos, you would not believe it.

754
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,560
Six times répétition for 36!

755
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,290
Like it was enchanted or something.

756
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,690
The croupier asked me if we are related to him.

757
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,690
I told him "He is our brother-in-law, Antonis". And he says...

758
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,940
"We haven't seen such a good player in ages."

759
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,960
You know why he said that?

760
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,510
Because he tipped the shit out of him.

761
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,360
No, Panos. I was in charge of tipping.

762
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,460
I pretended throwing them a chip...

763
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,040
...they said "Thank you"...

764
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,040
...and I put the chip back in my pocket.

765
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,510
 We are broke, we can't tip.

766
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,760
Squeeze her tight you redneck.

767
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,360
But watch out for any dangerous swelling.

768
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,040
Panos, let them be.

769
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,790
Antonis saved us.

770
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:19,560
And Clytemnestra, could be the woman every man dreams of meeting once in his life.

771
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,560
You are payed off, right? He payed you to sweet-talk me.

772
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:27,610
Tell me, the rat saw the cheese, but did he see the trap?

773
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:29,290
What do you mean, Panos?

774
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,990
They let him win today, so that tomorrow he loses twice as much.

775
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,040
And the chick...

776
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,360
...once they suck him dry, she is gone.

777
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,990
Won't you eat your eggs?

778
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,460
That half-wit fuck boy.

779
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,810
We gathered you all here, stupid southerners...

780
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,040
...and you are stealing our bread.

781
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,400
Panos, I wonder...

782
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,810
...if this Ms. Joan Pappos comes back one day...

783
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,810
...and asks for the candleholders.

784
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,760
What did he tell you when you woke him up?

785
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,140
He says he will be down in half an hour. I leave, they ask for Mr. Arbouzoglou.

786
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,610
I pick up the phone again, he asks "did you have breakfast yet?"

787
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:34,410
I say, "no".

788
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,460
He says, "Get some and charge it to room 331".

789
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,840
Empty gestures like that are the shepherd's favorite.

790
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,610
Nevertheless, he thought about us, Panos.

791
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,760
Because, people who bask in their happiness usually don't think of others.

792
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,060
Tell me, do you remember the code-word?

793
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,960
Now, you think we mean you harm?

794
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,090
That we don't want you to enjoy yourself a bit?

795
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,610
That we are not your brothers-in-law?

796
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,840
Isn't it you who takes care of the elders and my sisters?

797
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,760
Isn't it you who pays for the study help for the kids?

798
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,310
- Didn't you go to the taxman...
 - Didn't you go to the taxman to save us?

799
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:16,440
You told him...

800
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,040
"If those two poor souls..."

801
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,010
"...who work since they were twelve, neglected to VAT once or twice, are guilty..."

802
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,190
"...then half of Greece should be behind bars."

803
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:26,390
And he tells you "I am just doing my job".

804
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:29,760
And you tell him "PASOK came to teach you that you job is..."

805
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,940
"...to stand next to the people and solve their problems."

806
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,740
- And I go to the taxman...
- And I go to the taxman...

807
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,540
...and he tells me "what a magnificent person that brother-in-law of yours."

808
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,090
"It is people like that who should govern us!" And I think to myself...

809
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,910
Antonis, I wish your mother was here to hear this...

810
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:45,760
...and rejoice, that poor woman.

811
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,210
Yes, but you vote for New Democracy.

812
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,740
That is indeed true.

813
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,140
Other party memebers say...

814
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,360
..."Not even your brothers-in-law vote for PASOK..."

815
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,660
"...and you dream of becoming MP?"

816
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,860
And you didn't flip them off?

817
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,610
Who told you this? I'll deck his face and teach him not to be ignorant.

818
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,190
They are being ignorant.

819
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,790
I'll tell him "Come here you ashole.."

820
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,940
"...Did you even ask why I have to vote for New Democracy?"

821
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,640
If Psomiadis told you "Cut the crap and vote for my grandson..."

822
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,190
"...because I put bread on your table and not PASOK", what would you do?

823
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,310
That, if he didn't work with you, two families would out in the street?

824
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,210
Relax, your blood pressure will spike again.

825
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,410
Let is spike! Let it reach 24, let me die right here in front of him!

826
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,510
Look how they divide us.

827
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,510
And Psomiades comes, elections eve...

828
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:44,160
...and brings some Touloubes and some sealed election sheets.

829
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,160
And I count the sheets and ask him "Mr. Vasilis..."

830
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,690
"...me, plus my wife, my father and my sister is four..."

831
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,060
"...plus Michails, his wife and his mother, that's seven..."

832
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,010
"...Why eight sheets?"

833
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:55,860
And he says "What about the mother of your in-law, Antonis."

834
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,360
So, my mother voted for New Democracy?

835
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,890
What were my options, Antonis?

836
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,460
I took her to the station, gave her the election sheet...

837
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,990
...and told her "Ms. Vasiliki, Antonis said to vote it."

838
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,140
She crossed herself, kissed it..

839
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,090
...corssed it as well thrice...

840
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:22,090
...and threw it in the ballot box!

841
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,790
Antonis, woohoo!

842
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:32,310
Clytemnestra, woohoo!

843
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:35,860
Antonis, look it's Clytemnestra. Woohoo!

844
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,560
Father...

845
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,080
Clytemnestra, help! Clytemnestra, help!

846
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,060
 - Woe us.
 - We came Mr. Michalis

847
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:12,310
...because Ms. Clytemnestra called us and told us where you are.

848
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,310
They throwing two families to the streets.

849
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,140
We hired a cab so that we can entertain you.

850
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,960
Help me.

851
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,240
The jacket! Take off his jacket!

852
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,240
Take it off.

853
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,110
Michalis!

854
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:45,710
Hang the jacket somewhere.

855
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:51,200
Let him get some air. Why did you do this to us Antonis?

856
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,210
Such good people...

857
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,210
...yet such a drama.

858
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:01,260
<i>It has been a month.</i>

859
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,210
<i>The machines are gathering rust...</i>

860
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:10,910
<i>...and the children are cold and hungry.</i>

861
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:22,160
<i>Flyers are handed out in the streets of Athens.</i>

862
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,310
<i>Workers are asking for solidarity.</i>

863
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:38,510
<i>Flyers are handed out in the streets of Athens.</i>

864
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:45,660
<i>Workers are asking for solidarity.</i>

865
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,240
That which comes as an evolution in labor relations...

866
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,060
...could be something unknown...

867
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,440
...and beyond our comprehension.

868
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,860
Michalis!

869
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:05,760
The children of the future will grow up in a new reality...

870
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,940
...a reality, which we will propably never know.

871
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,190
Michalis!

872
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,190
I'm busy Panos.

873
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:18,210
In this critical moment, PASOK is the only party that can stand beside the people...

874
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,260
...and lead them to the threshold of this new world...

875
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,460
...without having to sink them into despair and marginalize them.

876
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,690
See?

877
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:28,110
We have never heard such nice words like that.

878
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,110
Who will tell them to us?

879
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,810
The Right is not discoursing in the level of ideas...

880
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:36,140
...but, stuck to the old mentality, they prefer to bribe the souls of the people.

881
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:36,910
Exactly!

882
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:39,440
In the meanwhile, us, you tell us to help with the elections...

883
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,840
...so, we ask "where do you want your child to be positioned in?"

884
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,940
Or, "Do you need a loan?", to keep the people happy.

885
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,460
Well done Mr. Panos!

886
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,940
Remember in Stavroupoli? You call us...

887
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,740
..."Come lift Venizelos up to the stage".

888
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,760
And when you got off the Mercedes me and Michalis picked him up...

889
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,410
...and it is since that day I have this backpain.

890
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,660
You sacrificed a lot.

891
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,660
But, how can I tell my father...

892
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,860
...that mother voted for New Democracy?

893
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,090
But Antonis, your father has been dead for 25 years.

894
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,210
He was an anti-authoritarian in Papaditsa.

895
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:13,740
He was drinking his coffee alone in the village square and then he came home.

896
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,840
His mother would say...

897
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,890
..."Giannis, don't despair that no one is saying hello to you."

898
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,890
"You forgive them."

899
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:29,440
When in 1982, on St. Johns day, his namesday, he came into my dream, I told him...

900
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,160
"Father..."

901
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,440
"...the blessed day has come!"

902
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,990
"The People now have the power in their hands!"

903
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,710
Mr. Antonis, we vote for New Democracy...

904
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,460
...but, now that we have heard the story of your dad...

905
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,890
...we will vote for PASOK.

906
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,890
Right Archontoula?

907
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,320
When I tell you he was not feeling well, you better believe me.

908
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,910
Yes, similar to the one Panos had but a bit less serious.

909
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,910
Now he is giving a speech.

910
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:02,540
Of course he is giving a speech, you never know when elections might pop up!

911
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,140
We start in half an hour.

912
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,840
If we are having the lamb, start with it now.

913
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,140
And we can reheat it if we arrive too late.

914
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,140
All right, Eleni.

915
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,910
Antonis, with Panos we will arrange for some quality fish.

916
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,060
I don't want fish.

917
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,410
What do you want?

918
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:19,140
Kokoretsi.

919
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,240
Kokoretsi?

920
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,490
Leave it up to me.

921
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,610
Panos, he does not want normal Kokoretsi, he wants it Papadits-style.

922
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:27,340
Papaditsa-style, of course. Leave it up to me I said.

923
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:41,410
<i>I will become the step that will help you rise.</i>

924
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,790
<i>I will become your cry of passion.</i>

925
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:50,910
<i>You'll love me you'll see, you'll love me.</i>

926
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:56,060
<i>I will laugh for me. I will pay for me.</i>

927
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:00,940
<i>Because, until this day...</i>

928
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,940
Two thousand one hundred seventy.

929
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,360
Two thousand one hundred eighty.

930
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,360
Two thousand one hundred ninety.

931
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,010
Two thousand two hundred.

932
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,940
Two thousand two hundred ten.

933
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,610
Two thousand two hundred twenty.

934
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:13,190
Two thousand two hundred thirty.

935
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,690
Two thousand two hundred forty.

936
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:17,460
Two thousand two hundred fifty.

937
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:21,060
<i>...everything I did, I did for you.</i>

938
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,360
That's enough.

939
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,310
Mister, still dirty.

940
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,890
Get done with it! I want them dirty goddammit!

941
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,440
Damn Albanians...

942
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,040
...we let you wander around and you steal the peoples bread!

943
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,160
You will eat the Papaditsa-style Kokoretsi to regain yourself.

944
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,440
And once you feel better, we start to meet our families.

945
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,440
What are you talking about? Did you ask him if he is in the state to travel?

946
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,060
I don't have any cash left.

947
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:47,810
It got wet.

948
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,690
We tried to save it Antonis, but the bills kept dissolving in our hands.

949
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:54,360
We will loan you some, and you give it back to us whenever you can.

950
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,610
But, you gambled all of it away.

951
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:00,310
We did. But we regained it. Some from non-tips, some from this, some from that.

952
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,660
- But, you owe me money.
- You will get it.

953
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,760
Panos says to now mess up the loans.

954
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,990
We owe you, you owe us...

955
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:08,990
...and whoever can will pay his share back.

956
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,400
So, you are leaving.

957
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,860
I must.

958
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,290
You must...

959
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:21,190
And I must learn to accept everything as it comes.

960
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,480
<i>It is my fault...</i>

961
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:40,110
<i>...now that I hurt and cry alone...</i>

962
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,040
<i>...it is my fault.</i>

963
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,990
<i>"Stay, I want you, I love you"</i>

964
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,940
<i>I couldn't find the strength to say.</i>

965
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:51,010
<i>Now what can I say?</i>

966
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:53,440
<i>It is my fault.</i>

967
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:59,360
<i>Why shouldn't I stop you from leaving?</i>

968
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,690
<i>Stand at the door and not let you go.</i>

969
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:10,840
<i>Why shouldn't I stop you from leaving?</i>

970
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:16,740
<i>Why shouldn't I call 911 and tell dispatch...</i>

971
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:21,090
<i>...that I won't make it.</i>

972
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:25,840
<i>That I won't make it.</i>

973
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,590
Mr. Panos, congratulations!

974
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,000
I assure you that I have never eaten such a delicious kokoretsi.

975
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,990
Cheers to PAOK!

976
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:49,290
PAOK! PAOK! PAOK! PAOK! PAOK!

977
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,290
<i>Why shouldn't I stop you from leaving?</i>

978
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:04,460
You have had your fair share of women.

979
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,240
<i>Why shouldn't I stop you from leaving?</i>

980
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:20,010
<i>Why shouldn't I call 911 and tell dispatch...</i>

981
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:23,460
<i>...that I won't make it.</i>

982
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,520
<i>That I won't make it.</i>

983
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:57,640
<i>Why shouldn't I stop you from leaving?</i>

984
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:03,740
<i>Stand at the door and not let you go.</i>

985
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:09,560
<i>Why shouldn't I stop you from leaving?</i>

986
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:15,410
<i>Why shouldn't I call 911 and tell dispatch...</i>

987
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:20,690
<i>...that I won't make it.</i>

988
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:26,610
<i>That I won't make it.</i>

989
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,120
You failed Lothario...

990
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,240
So, you thought we don't love you?

991
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,240
But you are solid.

992
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:48,740
If you didn't just regurgitate all your speeches you would be top.

993
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,790
And we would also be top alongside you.

994
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,240
And the girl is top as well.

995
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,460
Top league.

996
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,460
PAOK.

997
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:57,090
But, will you leave four kids behind?

998
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:59,410
And Eleni and his mother too, Panos.

999
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,810
She is a girl of substance.

1000
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:01,960
What substance?

1001
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,640
We communicate, Panos.

1002
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,890
That's what a woman is about?

1003
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,040
No.

1004
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,590
But a woman can love and give herself.

1005
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,490
And her relationship to a man determines her destiny...

1006
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:13,140
...which many times is unmerciful.

1007
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,440
There it is again with the PASOK-speak,
so we can't decode what you are saying.

1008
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,060
We'll live a life we can't imagine.

1009
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,340
Fuck off.

1010
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:20,490
What life?

1011
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:24,140
When you get the permit from the party headquarters
and we open the betting house...

1012
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,590
...our wives will make dough and not care about us.

1013
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,510
- And is that good?
-Of course it is!

1014
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,960
They will make a houndred grand a day.

1015
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,390
- Pure income?
-Pure as a diamond!

1016
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,960
- So we are going to divorce them?
-We will keep custody of the kids.

1017
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,410
They can't forbid us from seeing our kids, Antonis!

1018
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,990
When I woke up on Christmas Eve.

1019
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:45,410
Eleni was sitting by the window.

1020
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,410
I said "Good day" but she did not answer.

1021
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,860
- She was crying.
Crying?

1022
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,040
Yes. She was crying with sadness.

1023
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,290
Then she went to the living room.

1024
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:57,290
I followed her.

1025
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,940
She took our kid's picture from cupboard
and was looking at it.

1026
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,940
- Which picture?
From our kid that drowned.

1027
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,210
That was fifteen years ago, Eleni was a girl back then.

1028
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:07,840
Yes. And she said...

1029
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,040
...if the ocean did not take it...

1030
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,640
...we would be together, happy.

1031
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,340
I had the same.

1032
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,710
Christmas Eve and she starts with how I don't earn enough...

1033
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,560
...and how the old perv is taking advantage of us.

1034
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,060
And I start slapping her around...

1035
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,060
...and make me a coffee and I see her...

1036
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,560
...talking with your wife on the phone.

1037
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,540
My wife didn't do anything out of the ordinary this Christmas.

1038
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,790
And she calls me two days ago and she was acting all nice...

1039
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:31,260
"Panos, when are you coming?"

1040
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,010
We've been alone for a month.

1041
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,510
Like she had a clue.

1042
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:36,940
Doesn't matter.

1043
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,940
Are they having a good time now?

1044
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:41,440
Once we get there, are they going to annoy our balls off?

1045
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,840
We just don't get it, Panos.

1046
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,060
Doesn't matter.

1047
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,840
Remember the woodcocklings that Matoula
and the old perv brought?

1048
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,410
The ones we cooked in wax paper?

1049
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,210
I do.

1050
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,840
Matoula would take them out of the oven
and mouthfeed the old perv.

1051
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,040
And we didn't get as much as a wing.

1052
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,340
And she said, "My Koulis, the poor woodcocklings..."

1053
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,790
"...came from Africa and didn't have
a clue about what awaits them".

1054
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,140
He put everything away!

1055
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:00,690
Didn't leave a feather.

1056
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:04,590
Yes! Our fates will be the same as the woodcocklings!

1057
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:42,920
<i>I saw a tear in your eye...</i>

1058
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,310
<i>...which you wipe away with dignity and pass me.</i>

1059
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:51,660
<i>And when you reach the last step...</i>

1060
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:55,190
<i>...you stop for a moment and look at me in silence.</i>

1061
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:05,280
<i>It is your right to stay or leave.</i>

1062
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,790
<i>You are answerable to no one.</i>

1063
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:14,460
<i>Don't feel guilt for what you are leaving behind.</i>

1064
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:18,710
<i>All our mistakes are mine.</i>

1065
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:23,490
<i>It is your right to stay or leave.</i>

1066
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:28,010
<i>You are answerable to no one.</i>

1067
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:32,560
<i>Don't feel guilt for what you are leaving behind.</i>

1068
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,660
<i>All our mistakes are mine.</i>

1069
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:56,010
Finally! It's noon!

1070
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:58,310
I had to gather our things alone and it's still my fault!?

1071
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,490
So, I'm not allowed to have back-pain this one time?

1072
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:01,810
Must we fight?

1073
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,810
I really don't get him sometimes...

1074
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:13,680
Ms. Archontoula, Ms. Soultana, we will come and see you once a week at the least.

1075
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,210
Panos, Antonis, right?

1076
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,210
But of course.

1077
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:28,960
Visit again Mr. Antonis! Visit again Mr. Panos!

1078
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,840
- What is up?
- What is up?

1079
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,440
- Why did we stop?
- Antonis did.

1080
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,440
Michalis, we have to stay here a bit and recuperate.

1081
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,760
And take a swim too.

1082
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,890
So that we don't catch the heat in the ferry.

1083
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:40,710
- And in the evening...
- What evening?

1084
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,140
Before sunset we will be at Thasos.

1085
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,440
Good idea and I agree, but I am worried that they will get worried.

1086
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,110
- Who will get worried?
- Our families.

1087
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,860
But, you will go and let them know we are coming.
How will they worry?

1088
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:53,910
Wait a minute. So I go alone and you come later?

1089
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:56,060
Yes, that's what we've been saying the whole time.

1090
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,640
<i>I</i>, deflate the tires!

1091
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,640
<i>I</i>, mix sugar into the gas!

1092
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,660
<i>I</i>, forget my cigarette lit and everything burns to hell! That's what <i>I</i> do!

1093
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,340
Why the fuck are you yelling?

1094
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,790
Did you stare Death in his eyes, like me and Antonis?

1095
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:16,360
I'm the fool!

1096
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,640
Did you drop into the lake, with leeches suckling the blood out of you?

1097
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,060
I'm the addlehead!

1098
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:26,760
Did you get stuck in the mud, with water-snakes slithering up on you?

1099
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,840
What am I, chopped liver?!

1100
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,880
All three of us shall stay.

1101
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:53,120
But, we will go swim only once.

1102
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,840
We will eat something light.

1103
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,590
We will take a nap.

1104
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:59,340
And, as soon as the sun sets and it gets cooler...

1105
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,660
...we leave for our families immediately.

1106
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:11,150
<b>This has been a labour of love, dedicated to the memory of the great Stavros Tsiolis.</b>

1107
